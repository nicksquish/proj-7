# Neighborhood Map Project 7

This is my submission for project 7 of the Udacity Front-End NanoDegree. It is an app utilizing Google Maps and Foursquare API to display and allowing filtering of venues in my neighborhood! The purpose was to build on my knowledge of React.js, Google Maps, and the use of external APIs.
